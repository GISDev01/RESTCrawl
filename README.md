# REST Crawler Overview

## Features

This project is intended to provide a base resource that allows someone to crawl an ArcGIS Server REST endpoint using Python, and retrieve all of the service URLs that are either publicly available, or available via a token. 

This repository uses the 'urllib' libraries so as to be compatible with out-of-the-box functionality. This makes it much easier to run the script without any pip business needed at the expense of a little more code.
